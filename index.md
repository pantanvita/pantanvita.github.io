## About Me

I am a PhD student at the Department of Molecular Cell Biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of Prof. Tami Geiger.
With an academic foundation in Biotechnology, I have developed a keen interest in exploring the intricate cellular signaling networks that regulate cancer heterogeneity and complexity. My long-term scientific interests lie at the interface of proteogenomics and cancer biology to enhance personalized medicine.

## Research

I am interested in studying the intra-tumor heterogeneity and interactions within the tumor microenvironment by employing spatial proteomics. This coupled with mass spectrometry-based proteomics will allow us to obtain a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the spatial organization and the proteomic interplay between tumor and immune cells.
