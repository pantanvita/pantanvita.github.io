## About Me

Hi, I am a PhD student at the Department of Molecular Cell Biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of [Prof. Tami Geiger](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/TGeiger/home).

With an academic foundation in Biotechnology, I have developed a keen interest in exploring the intricate signaling networks that regulate cancer heterogeneity. My long-term scientific interests lie at the interface of proteogenomics and cancer biology to enhance personalized medicine.

Apart from working in the lab, I enjoy swimming, playing badminton, reading fiction novels and hiking!
